Goal:
Run two threads, if either one fails, kill the main thread.

Simple example:
	Developer Sid - https://github.com/developerSid/ThreadDoer - run Main.java for a simple example

Queue monitoring example:
 Lib:
	- Spring JMS
	- ActiveMQ (embeded so you don't have to install ActiveMQ at all)

	The two threads are basically two queue monitors. The queue monitors are in while true loops but will die as soon as a certain condition fails. In this case if it gets a message that is not equal to "Yes".
		Run PutMessagesOnQueue.java to put simple text messages in the queues
		Run MainWithSpring.java to see the queue monitors in action
